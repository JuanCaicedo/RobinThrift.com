These are programming and non-programming things I found interesting this past week (10.11.14 - 23.11.14) and why:

- [Golang Examples](http://golang-examples.tumblr.com/)
    - Learning a new language, and especially one with so many interesting features, is difficult without good examples.
- [Gyver](https://github.com/reimertz/gyver)
    - A clever little tool that helps you organize your thoughts and ideas or just gives you inspiration.



Note, I found them this week, it does not mean they are new this week.
