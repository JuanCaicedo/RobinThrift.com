Hi, my name is Robin Thrift, I am an 19–year–old computer science student and web developer from Hannover, Germany.

This is my blog and my personal little space on the web where I hope to be sharing info, tutorials, discussions and so on.

After building a static site with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which was amazingly easy, I decided to go with something else, preferably JavaScript based. Obviously there's no shortage of static site generators built for node.js, however most seemed clunky. Then I found [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), which is arguably even more elegant than Jekyll. I liked the fluent style and extensibility.


The fonts "Sanchez" (for the headings) and "Open Sans" (copy) are provided by the amazing [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/#).


I will publish more on the process of creating this site in some upcoming blog posts which I will link to here later.
